What is the correct answer to this question: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n\nChoices:\n(A)10^-11 eV\n(B)10^-8 eV\n\n(C)10^-9 eV\n(D)10^-4 eV\nFormat your response as follows: \"The correct answer is (insert answer here)\"\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about two quantum states with different energies and lifetimes. We need to find the energy difference that allows them to be clearly resolved. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, there's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula is \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, maybe it's \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2? Either way, the idea is that the shorter the lifetime of a state, the larger the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nSo each state has a certain energy and a certain lifetime. The uncertainty in their energy levels would be inversely proportional to their lifetimes. Therefore, each energy level isn't perfectly defined but has a sort of \"width\" due to their finite lifetimes. To resolve two energy levels, the difference between their energies should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, their energy ranges would overlap too much, making them indistinguishable.\n\nLet me write down the given data. State 1 has energy E1 and lifetime \u03c41 = 10^-9 seconds. State 2 has energy E2 and lifetime \u03c42 = 10^-8 seconds. The energy difference we need is \u0394E = |E1 - E2|. But we need to ensure that \u0394E is larger than the combined energy uncertainties \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, using the uncertainty principle, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t). Let me compute the uncertainties for each state.\n\nFirst, let's recall that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the answer options are in electron volts (eV), I need to convert that. Also, 1 eV is 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. Maybe there's a more convenient value for \u0127 in eV\u00b7s?\n\nYes, I think \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s. Let me confirm that. Planck's constant h is about 4.135667696 \u00d7 10^-15 eV\u00b7s, so \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s. Right.\n\nSo for each state:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u03c41) = (6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 \u00d7 10^-9 s) = (6.582 \u00d7 10^-16) / (2 \u00d7 10^-9) eV.\n\nCalculating that: 6.582 / 2 = ~3.291, and 10^-16 / 10^-9 = 10^-7. So \u0394E1 \u2248 3.29 \u00d7 10^-7 eV \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly for \u0394E2:\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u03c42) = (6.582 \u00d7 10^-16) / (2 \u00d7 10^-8) eV.\n\nSame calculation: 6.582 / 2 \u2248 3.291, and 10^-16 / 10^-8 = 10^-8. So \u0394E2 \u2248 3.29 \u00d7 10^-8 eV.\n\nTherefore, the total uncertainty is \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 10^-7 + 3.3 \u00d7 10^-8 = approx 3.6 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. Wait, 3.3 \u00d7 10^-7 is 0.33 \u00d7 10^-6, and adding 0.033 \u00d7 10^-6 gives 0.363 \u00d7 10^-6 eV, which is 3.63 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.\n\nSo to clearly resolve the two energy levels, the actual energy difference between E1 and E2 must be significantly larger than this total uncertainty. The question says \"clearly distinguish,\" so maybe the energy difference should be at least a few times larger than the combined uncertainty. But the options given are 10^-11, 10^-8, 10^-9, 10^-4 eV.\n\nLooking at the numbers: the combined uncertainty is ~3.6 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be larger than that. Let's see the options:\n\n(A) 1e-11 eV \u2013 way smaller than 3.6e-7, so no.\n\n(B) 1e-8 eV \u2013 0.00000001 eV. Our combined uncertainty is ~0.00000036 eV (since 1e-7 is 0.0000001). So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.00000036. So B is too small.\n\n(C) 1e-9 eV \u2013 0.000000001 eV. Still smaller than 3.6e-7. Not enough.\n\n(D) 1e-4 eV \u2013 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 3.6e-7. So D is way bigger. So the answer would be D?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nLet me recalculate \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFor \u0394E1: \u03c41 is 1e-9 s. So \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41) = 6.58e-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.58e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.29e-7 eV. Correct.\n\n\u0394E2: \u03c42 is 1e-8 s. So \u0394E2 \u2248 6.58e-16 / (2 * 1e-8) = 3.29e-8 eV. Correct.\n\nTotal uncertainty is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approx 3.62e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than this. The options are:\n\nA: 1e-11 eV \u2013 way smaller.\n\nB: 1e-8 eV \u2013 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so 0.1e-7 vs 3.6e-7. Still smaller.\n\nC: 1e-9 eV is 0.001e-6 eV (since 1e-9 = 0.001e-6). The total uncertainty is 0.36e-6 eV. So 0.001e-6 is 0.001 vs 0.36 \u2013 nope, still smaller.\n\nD: 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. Which is 1e-4 eV. Comparing to 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000036 eV. So 0.0001 is much larger. Therefore, D is the only option that's larger than the combined uncertainty. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another approach. Sometimes, in spectroscopy, the resolution is determined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the energy levels. The uncertainty principle gives the natural line width. The energy difference between two levels must be larger than the sum of their FWHMs to be resolved. So if each level has a width of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the minimum resolvable difference is \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Therefore, the actual energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than that sum. Hence, the answer is D, which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. The other options are all smaller. Therefore, D is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether two quantum states with energies $ E_1 $ and $ E_2 $ can be clearly distinguished, we must consider the energy uncertainties associated with their finite lifetimes.
